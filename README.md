This is repository is being used to collect and share info on our 3D printers.
It was created by the 3D printer club.

Most of the info will be in the wiki.

Examples of what we are collecting:

- profiles for each of our printers
- filament settings for each of the printers
- tips and tricks for Orca slicer
- informal minutes/notes from our meetings
- progress reports and notes on our projects
- tips and tricks on setting up octoprint / remote monitoring for our printers
